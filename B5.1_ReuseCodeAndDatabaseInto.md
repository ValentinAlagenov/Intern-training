# Extend the Tic-Tac-Toe game for 2 players

You are going to reuse the code from the previous task and extend it for 2 players. Clone the repository, don't commit in the existing project!
The screens are going to be changed as follows:

## Entry screen
Here you and the other player input your names, the rest of the buttons are the same.

## Game screen 
Here the players play in sequence until some of them wins. There should be some indication which player's turn is in action. The win/lose message should be changed - "Player X wins". After the game ends the two players' win/lose score is incremented a [database](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/index.html). The database will have a single table with the schema "player, wins, loses".

## Statistics screen 
It shows a list of top 10 players (read from database) sorted by wins/loses ratio or wins (can be switched).

If you have achieved good code separation (view/game rules/game management) in the previuos task you should be able to reuse large pieces of the code you've already written as-is. Else you'll get in a messy rewrite. This wastes time and effort already made so it's best to be avoided, especially when there's a deadline. Read about [Single Responsibility Principle](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/solid-part-1-the-single-responsibility-principle--net-36074) and how it can help you design classes with better separation of conserns. Ignore the fact that the language used in the article is PHP ;(, seems to be a good article.
