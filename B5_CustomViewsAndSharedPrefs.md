# Create a Tic-Tac-Toe game

You will create an implementation of the [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game. The app will have the following screens:

1. **Entry screen** with a "New game" button which opens the Game screen. Also there is an image of the game grid with some "X"s and "0"s. There is also "Statistics" button which opens the "Statistics" screen (see below).

2. **Game screen** where the user plays the game. It shows the game board. When the user enters the game he/she is randomly assigned with "X" or "0". This is shown in the UI. For example with a TextView which says "You: X, " Then the game starts playing vs dummy "AI", which randomly marks squares on the game board with its respective sign. Game ends according to the rules when the player or the AI scores a line of "X"s or "0"s. For the game board you will need a [custom view](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/custom-components.html). Read all the sub-articles there, they will be helpful. There's also a (outdated, non-gradle) sample project about a custom pie chart which can be used as a reference - there's a big button on the right side of the pages saying `DOWNLOAD THE SAMPLE` :). You'll need to handle touch events in your view so the [Making the View Interactive](https://developer.android.com/training/custom-views/making-interactive.html) part of the tutorial will be helpful. Try to have the code separated - the custom view should only contain view-related code about drawing, measuring and intercepting touch events. Then you may have a (view-)model of the game board where the current state of the board and the players is kept. You can have classes that contain the game rules and a master game engine class which puts everything together. Different ways to separate rules/UI/mechanics are possible, just don't put everything in the activity/custom view :). When the game ends an "You win!" or "You lose!" message is shown and a button "Start new game". Depending on the game result a "wins" or a "loses" score is incremented. For this you will need to read about [shared preferences](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences.html) where you can read/write simple key-value pairs of information. 

3. **Statistics screen** where the current number of wins and loses is displayed (read from shared preferences) and also wins/loses ratio.
