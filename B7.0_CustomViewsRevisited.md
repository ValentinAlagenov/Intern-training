# Create color picker view

Create an app that shows a color picker custom view like [this one](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=color+picker&t=ffab&atb=v103-5_f&ia=answer). 
Ignore the rightmost column. Interaction for the hex, RGB, HSV, and CMYK values should be the same as in the DuckDuckGo example above. When you select a color the values should be changed and vice versa - when you change a value manually the color views should be changed and the pointer position should be moved to the changed color value. Show the view in some showcase app with a single activity. Prepare for the view to be reused soon. :)
