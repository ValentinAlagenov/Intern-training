# Drawing app

Create a simple Paint-like drawing app with a list of saved drawings. The app consists of the following two screens:

1. **Drawings list** - shows a list of all saved drawings. Drawings can be deleted, renamed and shared. Clicking on a drawing opens the drawing in the drawing screen for editing. Option to start a new drawing also exists.

2. **Drawing screen** which is Paint-like with just a couple tools. The user has a brush with and color and an eraser. A shapes tool is also available - the user can draw circles, ovals and rectangles. The option to save the drawing exists and returns the user to the drawings list.


##Drawings list
 You have to load all the drawings that were saved by the app to the device memory (see below) into a RecyclerView. You should be able to switch between **grid** and **list** modes. A drawings' ViewHolder should contain the drawing **thumbnail**, the drawing name and modified date (the date when the drawing was saved). Research for a way to show a lightweight thumbnail and not scale down some [huge bitmap](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/graphics/). If needed save a second small thumbnail when saving the drawing. There should be a way to **delete**, **rename** and **share** a single drawing. Read about [menus](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/menus) and select the appropriate menu for this task. The menu should open like this [before](https://storage.googleapis.com/material-design/publish/material_v_12/assets/0Bx4BSt6jniD7c0ZsY292S1ZxZGs/components-menus-usage4a.png) -> [after](https://storage.googleapis.com/material-design/publish/material_v_12/assets/0Bx4BSt6jniD7eTlxdXpxd2Y3M00/components-menus-usage4b.png). The menu items should trigger the following actions:

  * The **delete** action should open a dialog that prompts the user to confirm the deletion. If confirmed - delete the file from the device memory and remove it from the list.
  * The **rename** action should open a dialog prompting for a new name. The EditText's default value should be the current name of the file. Confirmation action in the dialog renames the file in the device memory and in the list.
  * The **share** action opens an email app where some default text is added and email name and content and the file is attached to the email.

There's a [floating action button](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/floating-action-button) that opens the Drawing screen with an empty canvas.

Tapping on a drawing in the list opens the Drawing screen with the selected drawing for editing.

##Drawing screen
The drawing screens has the following elements:

1. **Canvas** view where the drawing is drawn. Empty if the new file option is chosen, else loads the selected bitmap. Touch events on the canvas are handled and do different actions depending on the selected tool.
2. **Tools palette** with a limited number of tools. Steal UI ideas where and how to position it from some other drawing app :). The selected tools should be **paint brush**, **eraser**, **color picker (pipette)**, **fill**, **rectangle** and **oval**. Clicking on selects it, long clicking selects it and opens a Color Picker dialog (not applicable for pipette). You should reuse the color picker from the previous assignment and show it in a dialog. The dialog should also allow for change in the tool size.

A **"Done"** button is also present in the palette. When the user clicks it a dialog is shown which prompts for a file name if the drawing is a new one. Else shows the name of the file as a default. The name can be changed, if it's not changed the file is overriden. Confirming action [saves the file](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/files) and returns the user to the drawings list.
